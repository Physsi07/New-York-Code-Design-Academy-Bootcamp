      <h2>New York Yankees</h2>
      <h3>Gleyber Torres Finishes Off a Yankees Rally to Beat the Astros</h3>
      <p>
        Two rookies and a team elder gave the Yankees one of their most thrilling and significant victories of the season, a 6-5 win over the Houston Astros in 10 innings Tuesday night. Brett Gardner, 34, the oldest position player on the team, hit two home runs,
        including a game-tying, two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth. Then the rookie infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres delivered 10th-inning hits that ended the game. The winning rally began with two outs in the 10th and Andujar facing
        Astros reliever Brad Peacock with an 0-2 count. Andujar laced the next pitch into the left-field corner for a double. Torres, who earlier in the day had been named the American League’s Player of the Week for the period ending on Sunday, followed
        with a single to right to drive in the winning run.

        The victory tied the three-game series against the Astros, who eliminated the Yankees from the American League Championship Series in seven games last year and then won the World Series, at a game apiece. In the rubber game Wednesday night, the Yankees
        ace Luis Severino will face his team’s playoff nemesis, Dallas Keuchel. Gardner led off Tuesday’s game with a homer, and the Yankees held a 2-1 lead against Charlie Morton, the Houston starter, who on April 30 had limited them to one run on two
        hits, and who came into the game with a 7-0 record and 2.04 earned run average. But things unraveled for the Yankees amid ragged defensive play and missed opportunities.

        They were three outs away from a routine 5-3 defeat in which they weren’t being dominated, as they had been on Monday against Justin Verlander. They were merely being outclassed by the team that had ended their last two playoff runs and that always seems
        to be just a little bit better than them. Then Andujar drew a leadoff walk, and after a strikeout by Torres, Gardner homered off reliever Chris Devenski.

        Torres — who hit .368 with five home runs and nine R.B.I. in six games last week to win the A.L. award — committed two errors in the game, one in the first and another in the seventh. “They’re young,” Sabathia said. “You got to live with the mistakes
        and see what happens at the end of the game.” Since his big-league debut on April 22, Torres has carried himself with the air of a player who has already been in the majors for years, and who intends to stay a while longer.

      <h2>Boston Red Sox</h2>
      <h3>Celebrities, Rain and the Red Sox Come On Strong in a Yankees Defeat</h3>
      <p>
        Everything was going just divinely for the Yankees. They had lost just once in three weeks, a surge that carried them to the best record in baseball. And for two consecutive nights, they had set somnambulant Yankee Stadium rocking with late-game conquests
        of the Boston Red Sox. Then on Thursday night, that old lightning rod, Alex Rodriguez, showed up — his girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, in tow. And just like that, with J-Rod taking in the game from a suite above the third-base dugout, the skies opened
        up, the Yankees ran out of late-game magic in this series, and a 5-4 loss to the Red Sox ensued. The defeat, which ended an eight-game winning streak and was only their second loss in the last 19 games, dropped the Yankees into a first-place tie
        with the Red Sox in the American League East. They have split six games this season.

        If there was some solace, it was that the Yankees did not go easily. After enduring a 55-minute rain delay and getting just one hit through six innings against Eduardo Rodriguez and reliever Matt Barnes, the Yankees rallied to tie the score with four
        runs in the seventh. But J.D. Martinez immediately seized the lead back for the Red Sox. His fly ball off Dellin Betances to lead off the eighth carried just over Aaron Judge’s outstretched glove, which collided with a fan, and the ball landed
        in the first row of the seats in right field.

      <p>
        Judge, who leapt at the wall in the playoffs last year to steal a home run from Francisco Lindor of Cleveland, did not blame the fan — who did not reach into the field of play. “I ran into him, but once you get past that line it’s fair game,” Judge said.
        “For me, if I get a better read and jump at the right time and get in a better position, I make the play.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The Yankees threatened in the eighth until Joe Kelly, who gave up Boston’s lead in the seventh, froze Neil Walker with a changeup with two runners aboard. Earlier in the inning, Kelly retired Tyler Austin on a fly ball to left — ending their first confrontation
        since Kelly hit Austin last month at Fenway Park, precipitating a bench-clearing brawl. By the time Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel — who was torched by the Yankees in their comeback win on Wednesday — retired Brett Gardner, Judge and Didi Gregorius
        in an orderly ninth inning, Rodriguez and Lopez had departed their perch.

        By the time Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel — who was torched by the Yankees in their comeback win on Wednesday — retired Brett Gardner, Judge and Didi Gregorius in an orderly ninth inning, Rodriguez and Lopez had departed their perch. Before the seventh,
        the biggest buzz in the ballpark had come just before the fifth-inning downpour, when fans seated in the second deck realized that royalty was sitting above them: Rodriguez, the former Yankee, dressed in a black trench coat, and Lopez, the pop
        star, wrapped in a lavender pea coat with her hair in a bun. Within moments, fans had turned away from the game, craning their necks and pointing their cellphone cameras at the couple. It was a rare appearance in the Bronx for Rodriguez, whose
        final game as a Yankee two years ago was punctuated by fierce thunder and lightning that cut short a ceremony to honor him. The skies opened up again on Thursday, with pouring rain and a few brief flashes of lightning and rolling thunder. When
        play commenced after the delay, Rodriguez and Lopez were shown on the stadium scoreboard. The cheers drew a thumbs up from Rodriguez and a wave from Lopez. EDITORS’ PICKS

        After arguing rather pointedly with Gibson on the second pitch of his final at-bat, Torres stepped out of the box to collect himself. He took a ball and then fouled off the next two pitches, both fastballs clocked at 94 m.p.h., before stroking the next
        one into right field to end the game. “You could feel him really just kind of slow it down and control the moment,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “It was just a really mature at-bat from a good player.” Correction: May 30, 2018 An earlier version
        of this article misstated the number of games over which Brett Gardner had hit three home runs. He hit three in four games, not three in three games.
