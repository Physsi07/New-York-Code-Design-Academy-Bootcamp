  <h1>BBTN: Are The Mets Cursed? Rizzo Ruling, Arrieta's Dominance </h1>

  <div>
    <p><span>Buster & Jerry Crasnick</span> discuss how the Phillies' are getting their money's worth out of Jake Arrieta,
      debate if the Mets are actually cursed and more (:35). Plus, Jessica Mendoza shares her thoughts on the
      Anthony Rizzo ruling and weighs in on an impossible poll question (28:36), while Paul Hembekides gives
      historical perspective on what Mike Trout and Mookie Betts are doing (39:25).</p>

    <p>Two weeks ago, after Mike Trout crossed the quarter mark of the season, we wrote he was on pace to challenge,
      by wins above replacement, the greatest season in history. Outrageously, we put his name alongside Babe Ruth's and declared Trout might be
      better. Naturally, this raised the ire of many readers, who were aghast, appalled, that we would dare put <span>Mike
      Trout</span> ahead of Babe Ru-No, actually they were mad we dared put Mike Trout ahead of Mookie Betts, who, we were reminded repeatedly, led Mike
      Trout "in pretty much every category." Every category except for WAR, one might have rebutted, except that, at
      the time, Mookie Betts led Mike Trout in WAR per game</p>

    <p>That's Mookie Betts through the 48 games he has played this season, against <span>Mike Trout</span> the first 48 games
      he played this season. We wrote about Trout, but Betts is also insane and phenomenal and very arguably playing as well as Ruth did during the best
      season in major league history, when Ruth produced 14.1 WAR. As long as we're talking about "on pace,"
      Betts is on pace to hit 50-plus homers, steal 40 bases, win the batting title, score more runs than anybody since Lou Gehrig and put up the highest
      American League slugging percentage since Ruth. He almost certainly won't do any of those things --
      "on pace" is a trap for overzealous sportswriters -- but he's done them for a third of a season. We didn't try to rebut the Mookie supporters because
      there was no reason for rebuttal. We support <span>Mookie! Betts</span></p>

    <p>We wrote about Trout, not Betts, in part because Mookie Betts has played fewer games, which matters a lot
      for "on-pace" reasons. Betts missed the Red Sox's 15th game with a bruised foot, their 21st game for
      a routine day off, their 27 and 28th games with a
      tight hamstring, and he has since missed their 53rd, 54th and 55th games with tightness in his side.
      (Trout has played every game so far.) Because of those missed games, Betts wasn't on pace to break Ruth's record for single-season WAR, and he still
      isn't. If he's exactly this good for the rest of the season, and plays every game, he'd end up at
      13.2 WAR, which would be only the second-greatest season in history. Psh.</p>
